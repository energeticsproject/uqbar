# Uqbar

Uqbar is a (**very early** work-in-progress) programming macrolanguage. It is different from languages you may be more familiar with (like, say, JavaScript and Python) in two senses:

1. It's bigger (syntactic superset of all LR-readable Context Free Grammars)
2. It has macros

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
